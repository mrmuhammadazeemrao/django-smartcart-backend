### Here's an explanation of each directory and file in the conventional Django project structure:


```
smartcart/ (project root folder)
│
├── smartcart/ (main project folder)
│   ├── __init__.py (empty file to indicate that this folder is a Python package)
│   ├── asgi.py (ASGI entry point for deploying the project with an ASGI server, e.g., Daphne)
│   ├── settings.py (contains settings/configuration for the project, like database, middleware, etc.)
│   ├── urls.py (contains the project-level URL configuration)
│   └── wsgi.py (WSGI entry point for deploying the project with a WSGI server, e.g., Gunicorn)
│
├── users/ (app folder for the 'users' app)
│   ├── __init__.py (empty file to indicate that this folder is a Python package)
│   ├── admin.py (contains admin site configurations for the app, like registering models)
│   ├── apps.py (contains the AppConfig class for the app, used for app configuration)
│   ├── migrations/ (directory for storing migration files generated by Django)
│   ├── models.py (contains the data models for the app, which define the database schema)
│   ├── tests.py (contains test cases for the app)
│   └── views.py (contains the views, which define the app's logic and render templates)
│
├── db.sqlite3 (SQLite database file, if using SQLite as the database for the project)
├── manage.py (command-line utility for managing the project, like running the development server, creating apps, etc.)
├── poetry.lock (lock file generated by Poetry to lock dependency versions)
└── pyproject.toml (configuration file for Poetry, containing project metadata and dependencies)

```


- smartcart/ (project root folder): The top-level folder containing the entire project, including the main project folder, app folders, and other project-related files.

- smartcart/smartcart/ (main project folder): Contains Django project files like settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, and asgi.py.

- smartcart/users/ (app folder): Contains the files for the users app, such as models.py, views.py, admin.py, etc. Each app you create should have its own folder in the project root folder.

- db.sqlite3: The SQLite database file for the project, if you're using SQLite as your database. This file is automatically generated by Django when you run the migrate command.

- manage.py: A command-line utility for managing the project. It provides commands to run the development server, create apps, make and apply migrations, etc.

- poetry.lock: A lock file generated by Poetry to lock dependency versions, ensuring that your project's dependencies are consistent across environments.

- pyproject.toml: A configuration file for Poetry, containing project metadata (name, version, authors, etc.) and dependencies (Django, other libraries, etc.).
